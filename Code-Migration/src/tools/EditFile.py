    Replaces specific text within a file.

    This tool is designed for precise, literal text replacement. It's crucial
    that `old_string` and `new_string` are exact, unescaped text snippets,
    including all whitespace and newlines.

    - If `old_string` is an empty string and the `file_path` does not exist,
      a new file will be created with `new_string` as its content.
    - If `old_string` is not empty, the tool will search for and replace
      all occurrences that exactly match `old_string`.
    - If the number of replacements found does not match `expected_replacements`,
      the operation will fail to prevent unintended changes.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The absolute path to the file to modify.
        old_string (str): The exact text to find and replace.
        new_string (str): The exact text to replace it with.
        expected_replacements (Optional[int]): The expected number of times
                                                `old_string` should be found.

    Returns:
        str: A success message detailing the number of replacements made.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If file_path is not an absolute path or is a directory.
        FileNotFoundError: If the file_path does not exist and old_string is not empty.
        PermissionError: If the file cannot be accessed or written to.
        Exception: For other unexpected errors, including occurrence mismatches.
