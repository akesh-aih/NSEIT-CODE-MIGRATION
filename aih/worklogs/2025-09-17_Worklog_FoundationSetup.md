### **Project Log: IIIRegistrationPortal Migration - Day 1 (Foundation Setup)**
**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Time:** Ending 20:44 PM

**Overall Goal:** Establish a functional Java/Struts/Spring application foundation and a health check module to verify core components.

---

#### **1. Initial Setup & Health Check Module Development**

*   **Action:** Confirmed existing project directory structure.
*   **Action:** Created necessary sub-directories for `com.nseit.health` module (action, dao, model, service, impl).
*   **Action:** Created `Health.java` (Model POJO).
*   **Action:** Created `HealthDao.java` (DAO Interface).
*   **Action:** Created `BaseDao.java` (Generic DAO utility class for `JdbcTemplate`).
*   **Action:** Created `QueryConstants.java` (Interface for SQL queries, added `HEALTH_CHECK = "SELECT 1"`).
*   **Action:** Created `HealthDaoImpl.java` (DAO Implementation, extends `BaseDao`, uses `JdbcTemplate`).
*   **Action:** Created `HealthService.java` (Service Interface).
*   **Action:** Created `HealthServiceImpl.java` (Service Implementation).
*   **Action:** Created `HealthAction.java` (Struts Action, initially `ModelDriven`).
*   **Action:** Created `health.jsp` (JSP View for health status).
*   **Action:** Created `web.xml` (Deployment Descriptor, configured Spring `ContextLoaderListener`, Struts `PrepareAndExecuteFilter`, Tiles Listener).
*   **Action:** Created `struts.xml` (Struts Configuration, mapped `health` action).
*   **Action:** Created `SpringBeans.xml` (Spring Configuration, defined `dataSource`, `jdbcTemplate`, `transactionManager`, `healthDao`, `healthService`, `healthAction` beans).
*   **Action:** Created `log4j2.xml` (Log4j2 Configuration, console appender, `DEBUG` level for `com.nseit`).

#### **2. Testing & Debugging Cycle**

**Issue 1: Struts 2 Package Name Mismatch**
*   **What we were doing:** Setting up initial Struts 2 components.
*   **Problem:** User reported `com.opensymphony` import errors in `HealthAction.java`.
*   **Resolution:** Confirmed user's manual fix to `org.apache.struts2` imports, acknowledging the package change in Struts 7.0.0.
*   **What we were doing:** Reviewing `pom.xml` for dependencies.
*   **Problem:** User reported `pom.xml` changes for Tiles.
*   **Resolution:** Reviewed `pom.xml`, confirmed correct Struts 7.0.0 and Tiles 3.0.8 dependencies, including `struts2-tiles-plugin`.

**Issue 2: Tomcat Startup Failure (Initial)**
*   **What we were doing:** Attempting to start the Tomcat server.
*   **Problem:** User reported `ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap`.
*   **Resolution:** Identified `tomcat7-maven-plugin` in `pom.xml` as incompatible with Tomcat 10.1.x. Instructed user to remove the plugin and deploy the WAR file manually to Tomcat 10.1.x.
*   **What we were doing:** Starting Tomcat after manual deployment.
*   **Problem:** User reported "no logs on console" after `startup.bat`.
*   **Resolution:** Instructed user to use `catalina.bat run` for direct console output and to check Tomcat's `logs` directory for detailed errors.

**Issue 3: Spring Context Failure (Database TimeZone)**
*   **What we were doing:** Starting Tomcat after manual deployment.
*   **Problem:** User reported `SEVERE: One or more listeners failed to start.` (from `catalina.bat run` output).
*   **Diagnosis:** Initial review of `web.xml` and `SpringBeans.xml` showed no errors. Hypothesized a runtime issue.
*   **Root Cause Discovered:** User provided `localhost.log` showing `FATAL: invalid value for parameter "TimeZone": "Asia/Calcutta"`.
*   **Resolution (Attempt 1 - `connectionInitSql`):** Added `connectionInitSql="SET TIME ZONE 'Asia/Kolkata'"` to `dataSource` bean in `SpringBeans.xml`.
*   **Problem:** Error persisted. User rejected `catalina.bat` modification.
*   **Resolution (Attempt 2 - `MethodInvokingFactoryBean`):** Implemented `MethodInvokingFactoryBean` in `SpringBeans.xml` to programmatically set `System.setProperty("user.timezone", "Asia/Kolkata")` during Spring context initialization. This was the successful fix for the time zone issue.

**Issue 4: Health Check Page Display (Empty Status)**
*   **What we were doing:** Accessing the health check page after successful server startup.
*   **Problem:** Health check page loaded, but "Status:" was empty.
*   **Diagnosis (Attempt 1 - `ModelDriven` pattern):** Hypothesized an issue with `ModelDriven` interceptor not updating the value stack correctly.
*   **Resolution (Attempt 1 - `HealthAction` code fix):** Modified `HealthAction.java` to explicitly update the `health` model object's status.
*   **Problem Introduced:** Compilation errors due to incomplete `HealthAction.java` modification (leftover `getModel()` method, renamed variable).
*   **Resolution:** Corrected `HealthAction.java` to fully remove `ModelDriven` implementation, rename `health` to `healthBean`, add `getHealthBean()` getter, and remove `getModel()`. Modified `health.jsp` to use `healthBean.status`.
*   **What we were doing:** Accessing the health check page after code fix.
*   **Problem:** Status still empty. Added extensive `DEBUG` logging to DAO, Service, and Action.
*   **Root Cause Discovered:** Logs showed `WARN org.apache.struts2.ognl.SecurityMemberAccess - ... is not allowlisted!`. Struts 2 security was blocking OGNL access to `Health` model properties.
*   **Resolution:** Added `<constant name="struts.allowlist.packageNames" value="com.nseit.*"/>` to `struts.xml`.
*   **What we were doing:** Accessing the health check page after `struts.xml` fix.
*   **Problem:** Security warning persisted due to Tomcat caching.
*   **Resolution:** Instructed user to perform a "deep clean" of Tomcat's `work` directory (deleting `Catalina` folder).

**Issue 5: Persistent `com.opensymphony.xwork2` Package Not Found**
*   **What we were doing:** Attempting to build the project after re-implementing `ModelDriven` in `HealthAction.java`.
*   **Problem:** Compiler reported `package com.opensymphony.xwork2 does not exist` and `cannot find symbol: class ModelDriven`.
*   **Resolution:** User performed a fix. (Details to be added later).

---

#### **3. Final Outcome**

*   **Result:** Health check page successfully displays "Status: OK".
*   **Confirmation:** All core components (Spring, Struts, Database connection, Logging) are now correctly configured and functional.

**Next Steps:** Begin migration of the **Login and User Management** module.
