## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this session was to analyze a legacy .NET application (`iiiexams.org`) and a reference Java application (`MRBPCW`) to create a detailed plan for migrating the .NET application to a new Java application that meets the client's specific architectural and stylistic requirements.

## 2. Initial Analysis: Reference Java Application (`reference_java_application_source_code`)

*   **Conclusion:** The reference application is a legacy Java web application built with Struts 2, Spring, and JSP, using XML-based configuration and manual dependency management.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Stack:** Struts 2, Spring 5.3.23, JSP, Apache Tiles, JasperReports, Log4j 2.
    *   **Architecture:** Classic layered MVC architecture.
    *   **Configuration:** XML-based (`web.xml`, `struts.xml`, `SpringBeans.xml`, `tiles.xml`).
    *   **Dependencies:** Managed manually by placing JARs in `WebContent/WEB-INF/lib`.
    *   **Bean Scope:** All Spring beans are `scope="prototype"`.
*   **Artifacts Created:**
    *   `REFERENCEdocs.md`: A detailed analysis of this reference application.

## 3. Analysis of `dotnet2java_old` Project

*   **Conclusion:** The `dotnet2java_old` project, which was a previous attempt at the migration, was fundamentally flawed. It was built using a modern Spring MVC stack with annotation-based configuration, which directly contradicted the client's requirements to follow the reference application's architecture.
*   **Key Discrepancies:**
    *   Used Spring MVC instead of Struts 2.
    *   Used annotation-based configuration instead of XML-based.
    *   Did not use Apache Tiles for UI layout.
    *   Violated numerous coding conventions outlined by the client (manual request parsing, transaction management in the wrong layer, hardcoded SQL queries, etc.).
*   **Artifacts Created:**
    *   `UpdatesRequired.md`: A detailed report outlining the discrepancies between the `dotnet2java_old` project and the client's feedback, with "before" and "after" examples.

## 4. Analysis of the .NET Source Code (`dotnet_source_code`)

*   **Conclusion:** The .NET application is a classic N-tier ASP.NET MVC application, but the **core business logic is implemented in stored procedures** in the SQL Server database.
*   **Key Findings:**
    *   **Architecture:** A 3-tier architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
    *   **Presentation Layer (`IIIRegistrationPortal2`):** ASP.NET MVC. Controllers are "fat" and contain logic that should be in a service layer.
    *   **Business Logic Layer (`IIIBL`):** A very thin wrapper that contains no real business logic.
    *   **Data Access Layer (`IIIDL`):** An abstraction layer that calls stored procedures. It does not contain any SQL queries.
    *   **Business Logic:** The most critical finding is that the business rules are in the database, not in the C# code.
*   **Artifacts Created:**
    *   `DotNetProjectAnalysis.md`: A detailed analysis of the .NET project.

## 5. Migration Plan

Based on the analysis of all three codebases, we have formulated a "divide and conquer" strategy for the new Java project.

*   **Strategy:**
    1.  **Analyze the Database:** The first and most important step is to extract and document the business logic from the SQL Server stored procedures.
    2.  **Build the Foundation:** Set up a new Maven project with the correct Struts 2, Spring, and Tiles configuration.
    3.  **Implement in Units:** Build the application feature by feature (e.g., User Management, URN Management), re-implementing the business logic from the stored procedures in a new Java service layer.
*   **Artifacts Created:**
    *   `DivideAndConquer.md`: A high-level plan outlining the migration strategy.
    *   `DetailedMigrationPlan.md`: A more granular plan with detailed sub-tasks for each phase and unit of the migration.
    *   `template.py`: A Python script to automatically generate the directory structure for the new Java project, based on the reference application's structure.
